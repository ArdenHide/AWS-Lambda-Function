# AWS Lambda Function

**AWS Lambda Function** is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to run your code without having to provision or manage servers. AWS Lambda supports several programming languages, including C#, Python, and Java.

## Custom Project Template

A custom project template is a way to create a pre-configured project template that can be used to start a new project. This template can include predefined files, settings, and project structure. By using a custom project template, developers can save time and effort by avoiding repetitive setup tasks for each new project.

## Adding Custom Project Template

To add the `AWS Lambda Function.zip` custom project template to Visual Studio 2022, follow these steps:

1. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to folder.
```
C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\Visual Studio 2022\Templates\ProjectTemplates\
```
2. Copy the `AWS Lambda Function (.NET 6.0).zip` or `AWS Lambda Function (.NET 8.0).zip` file into this folder.

3. (optional): If the template still doesn't appear, try unzipping the zip.

Once you have followed these steps, you should be able to create a new project based on the `AWS Lambda Function` custom project template.

## Tags

Alternatively, you can find the template by tags: `AWS` `C#` `Cloud` `Serverless`
