## Running a lambda function locally

Debugging executable assembly functions is a little different. This requires you to run `Amazon.Lambda.TestTool` first.

1. Run the below command to install the Mock Lambda Test Tool.
```bash
dotnet tool update -g Amazon.Lambda.TestTool-8.0
```

2. After that, navigate to `C:\Users\<username>\.dotnet\tools` location, you will see all the installed tools.

3. Run this tool via the command line, which starts the Test Tool in the browser at http://localhost:5050/ URL.

4. Now, switch back to Visual Studio, and set the `AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API` environment variable to `localhost:5050`.
    1. Right-click, and select Properties.
    2. Navigate to Debug > General tab, and select Open debug launch profiles UI
    3. Set the required environment variable, and close the window.

    4. This creates a `launchSettings.json` file like this.
    ```json
    {
      "profiles": {
        "AWSLambda.NET8.Demo": {
          "commandName": "Project",
          "environmentVariables": {
            "AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API": "localhost:5050"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

5. Now, run the application by pressing F5. This starts the app and executes the `main()` method.

6. Code in the `main()` method to start the Lambda Runtime looks for the `AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API` environment variable. Thatâ€™s why the Mock Lambda Test tool needs to be started first.

7. Now, go back to the lambda test tool, enter the event in the text box, and press the `Queue Event` button.

8. The moment you press the Queue Event button, the debugger is hit in Visual Studio.

9. So this is how you can debug and test your Lambda function.
